# Zwift Edit Events Extension

Provides a little bit of usability improves to Zwift's edit event UI, particularly, editing values
in the **Category A** section will apply to all other categories, and moves the **Publish** button
immediately below the **Category A** section. It also hides the event description, since this
can't be edited anyway.

This has been superseded by my new extension, https://github.com/jessicah/zwift-publish-events-from-sheets

Features in the new extension:
- Auto-publishing from a TSV document (Google Sheets as prime example)
- Bulk category editing
- Pre-filled change request forms from the event edit page
