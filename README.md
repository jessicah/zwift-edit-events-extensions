# Zwift Edit Events Extension

Provides a little bit of usability improves to Zwift's edit event UI, particularly, editing values
in the **Category A** section will apply to all other categories, and moves the **Publish** button
immediately below the **Category A** section. It also hides the event description, since this
can't be edited anyway.
